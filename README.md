# fosterCareRegs
This is a readable version of key foster care regulations in Kentucky.
I am brand new to coding and am using this as a way to apply what I'm learning. I'm focusing right now on the basics of html and css and hope to move to javascript soon.
Thank you for your attention and any comments!
